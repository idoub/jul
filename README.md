A nifty little **J**avascript **U**tility **L**ibrary
------------------------------------------------------------

# Features
* **Modular** - Each piece of functionality is defined in it's own module and can be included as you please.
* **Tiny** - At under 5kb (Minified and GZipped) it weighs in at less than a sixth of jQuery's size. And that's with _all_ the modules included!
* **Powerful** - 

# Installation
This repository only contains the source code for the library, no distribution files. If you want to use the library, simply clone and run `npm install`. Concatenated and minified files will be placed in a new **dist** folder and documentation will be generated in a **docs** folder.
