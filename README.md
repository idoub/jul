## Features
* **Modular** - Each piece of functionality is defined in it's own module and can be included as you please.
* **Tiny** - At under 5kb (Minified and GZipped) it weighs in at less than a sixth of jQuery's size. And that's with _all_ the modules included!
* **Powerful** - Includes the most useful features of other libraries without sacrificing size.
* **Compatible** - Works with IE9 and up as well as all modern browsers.

## Background


## Installation
This repository only contains the source code for the library, no distribution files. This is intended to prevent people from including the entire library for projects where they only need a few of the libraries features.

If you want to use the library, simply clone, modify `gulpfile.js` to include the modules that you need, and run `npm install`. Concatenated and minified files will be placed in a new **dist** folder and documentation will be generated in a **docs** folder.
