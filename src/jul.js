/**
 * This is the core underscore module required for everything else.
 * It defines the selector function which can be used to create a new `_` instance
 * wrapping the selected objects as well as defining an 'addModule' function
 * which can be used to extend the base `_` object in a safe way.
 * 
 * Calling underscore as a function internally creates a new object with
 * the jul as it's prototype. It also creates a property `_.e`
 * which is a reference to either:
 * * a list of elements located by the selector passed in as a parameter,
 * * the object passed in as a parameter if it is an array,</li>
 * * the object wrapped in an array if it is anything else.</li>
 *
 * Internally, this function uses [document.querySelectorAll]{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll}
 * to get an arraylike object of all matching elements when a selector is
 * passed to it.
 * 
 * @param    o - The object to be wrapped or a selector to identify the
 * elements to be wrapped.
 * @return {jul} - A new jul.
